# YSP 2024 Research Project
This study will be conducted on the genome of the Drosophila melanogaster fruit fly 
at the Korf Lab, under the direct supervision of Dr. Ian Korf. 

Our ultimate goal is to quantitatively predict the probabilities of alternative 
splices using computational analysis. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) help predict 
the probabilities of changing hidden states based on a sequence of observable 
phenomena. This project will utilize methods such as the forward-backward algorithm 
to analyze HMMs and identify alternative splice positions.
